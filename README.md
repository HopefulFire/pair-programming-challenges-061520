# Pair Programming Challenges - 061520

To get started, `fork` and `clone` this repository to your local machine and navigate into it with `cd`. Once you've cloned down the repo and moved into the directory:

```git remote add upstream https://github.com/brewchetta/pair-programming-challenges-061520.git```

This will give you the additional option to pull new challenges whenever they're released on the main fork.

You can now `cd` into the individual challenges, for example `cd 01-ruby-objects-build-a-sandwich`

On your local machine, whenever a new challenge gets released you can update the repo by navigating to `pair-programming-challenges-061520` and doing `git pull upstream`. You may have to commit your changes first with `git add . && git commit -m "your message here"`.
